/**
 * A file selected for a `fileUpload` question, queued for offline-first upload.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  1. User picks/captures a file → row inserted with `localPath` (private app storage),
 *     `boundResponseUuid = null`. The runner stores `clientUuid` as a placeholder in the
 *     question's answer (`fbint-file:<clientUuid>`).
 *  2. User submits the response → all referenced files get `boundResponseUuid` set.
 *  3. FileUploadWorker uploads each file (request signed URL via /storage, then PUT bytes)
 *     and writes back `uploadedFileUrl` + `uploadedAt`.
 *  4. ResponseSyncWorker only POSTs a response once every bound file has `uploadedFileUrl`.
 *     It substitutes placeholders with the URL and deletes the local file after success.
